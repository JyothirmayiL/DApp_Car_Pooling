# DApp_Car_Pooling
The goal of this project is to develop a decentralized application (DApp) that facilitates secure carpooling using a blockchain -based smart contract. This DApp will address the  common issues related to trust, payment, and safety in carpooling, providing a secure and transparent solution for users.
