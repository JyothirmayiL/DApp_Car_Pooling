# DApp_Car_Pooling
The goal of this project is to develop a decentralized application (DApp) that facilitates secure carpooling using a blockchain -based smart contract. This DApp will address the  common issues related to trust, payment, and safety in carpooling, providing a secure and transparent solution for users.

1. Register As Driver: Allows a user to register as a driver, specifying their route, the number of available seats, and the price per seat. Only registered users can call this function. 
2. Register As Passenger: Allows a user to register as a passenger, specifying their desired route. Only registered users can call this function. 
3. Find Carpool Match: Matches passengers with drivers based on compatible routes and availability of seats. This function should automatically create ride agreements and manage payments through smart contracts.
